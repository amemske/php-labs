<?
// Write a PHP function that takes an array of integers as input and returns the second smallest integer in the array. If the array has less than two integers, the function should return null.

// Here are some additional requirements and constraints for the function:

// The input array can contain both positive and negative integers.
// If the input array is empty or has only one element, the function should return null.
// The function should have a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
// The function should not use any built-in PHP functions that directly solve the problem (e.g. sort(), min(), max(), etc.).
